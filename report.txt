### **Write Up**

1. Describe any design decisions you made. These may be minimal for pa3

    - For `IntHistogram`, a simple logic of counting value as per the given value and adding to the hist bins is used for implementing estimateSelectivity.
    - For `JoinOptimizer`, the PlanCache class is used to cache the set of joins and computed the efficient join on the specified tables.

2. Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API

    - _**estimateSelectivity, addValue**_ : Added required class variables and implemented the addValue() method call & estimate selectivity for joins
    - _**orderJoins**_ : Implemented orderJoins which is using the give feature of PlanCache class to store the set of joins.

3. Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code

    - As per my knowledge, all the elements required for pa4 are complete in my assignment. The only part I could guess is the use of transactionId are not in use for anything as of now.

4. Describe how long you spent on the assignment, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing

    - For this assignment, I've spent around 1 week to understand and start myself writing code. The lab document is pretty descriptive
    and helped a lot along the way to implement each and every part of this assignment.

5. If you collaborate with someone else, you have to describe how you split the workload

    - I worked alone on this assignment but yes the discussion in labs, javadoc and slide for simpledb helped a lot to speed up.
